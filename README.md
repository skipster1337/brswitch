# brswitch v3.0 rewrite
I lost a big portion of the previous .py file somehow so I just nuked everything and started over. Now I actually split my code into separate files and define chunks of code as functions so it's much tidier and sane.  
The first working release of the rewrite version will only offer basic branch switching functionality, but more features will be added in the future.  
This readme file is also a placeholder. I will rewrite it with the first release.
