# brswitch v3.0 rewrite

I lost a big portion of the previous .py file somehow so I just nuked everything and started over. Now I actually split my code into separate files and define chunks of code as functions so it's much tidier and sane.  
The first working release of the rewrite version will only offer basic branch switching functionality, but more features will be added in the future.  
This readme file is also a placeholder. I will rewrite it with the first release.

# todo

## for v3.0s

- Write a simple readme showing how to use the program
- Clean up the code to use less redundant variables where possible
- Write better comments
- Make sure the script is cross-platform and does not rely on any OS features
  
Essentially first working version, don't expect much beyond basic functionality

## for v3.1

- Write a better, more in-depth readme
- Cover more edge cases within the script and use the readme to explain the errors
- Add support for branch creation within the script
- Add support for automatically closing and starting Steam for convenience
- Add support for switching to experimental branch
  
Feature parity with first version written in batch

## for v3.2

- Add support for "historical" branch (older versions of the game stored as Steam depots)
- Add support for dev branch switching

## for v3.3

- Add support for historical branch creation within the script (guides you through opening the console and downloading depots)
